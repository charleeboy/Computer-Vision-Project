## Tasks
### Day 1: Custom Datasets 
* Using Computer Vision (cv2), We capture pictures of MASK, No MASK, and BAD MASK with our web camera.
* Save the images and label them in the respective folders of mask, no mask, and bad mask by drawing rectangular bounding boxes around the face.
* Merged the mask, no mask, and bad mask images of our peers to create a large dataset to tran the model.
